    <p><strong>Africa</strong>. <em>There's nowhere like it on the planet for wildlife, wild lands and rich traditions that endure. Prepare to fall in love.</em></p><br>
<h2>Natural Beauty</h2>
<p>Whether you're a wide-eyed first-timer or a frequent visitor, Africa cannot fail to get under your skin. The canvas upon which the continent's epic story is written is itself astonishing, and reason enough to visit. From the tropical rainforests and glorious tropical coastline of Central Africa to the rippling dunes of the Namib Desert, from the signature savannah of the Serengeti to jagged mountains, green-tinged highlands and deep-gash canyons that mark the Great Rift Valley's continental traverse â€“ wherever you find yourself on this big, beautiful continent, Africa has few peers when it comes to natural beauty.</p>
<h3>New Africa</h3>
<p>The past retains its hold over the lives of many Africans, but just as many have embraced the future, bringing creativity and sophistication to the continent's cities and urban centres. Sometimes this New Africa is expressed in a creative-conservation search for solutions to the continent's environmental problems, or in an eagerness to break free of the restrictive chains of the past and transform the traveller experience. But just as often, modern Africans are taking all that is new and fusing it onto the best of the old.</p>
